# Decisions — Emotion Regulation (#590)

## D1: Strategy scope

**Choice:** All five Gross strategies — design for the complete process model
**Alternatives:**
- Three post-appraisal only (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) — simpler but incomplete model, paints into a corner if goal-level strategies need different abstractions later
- Two core only (reappraisal + suppression) — misses distraction which Petter et al. show dominates at high intensity
**Rationale:** Designing for the full model ensures the abstraction handles both post-appraisal (pipeline-level) and antecedent (goal-level) strategies cleanly. Implementation batched: Batch 1 = post-appraisal three, Batch 2 = goal-level two.
**Trade-offs:** Larger design scope; goal-level strategies touch GoalFormationStrategy which is a different pipeline integration point

## D2: Computation approach

**Choice:** LLM-driven with literature-structured prompting. Bosse/Petter models provide the framework (strategy families, intensity thresholds, personality mappings) as structured prompt context; the LLM performs actual regulation reasoning. Mechanize later based on empirical evidence of what becomes formulaic.
**Alternatives:**
- Fully mechanical (Bosse differential equations + Petter RL selector) — deterministic and testable, but risks producing rigid/unconvincing regulation like prior keyword filtering issues
- Hybrid (mechanical selection, LLM rendering) — reasonable compromise but premature optimization before we know what quality looks like
**Rationale:** Quality first, optimize later. Published equations look clean but we don't know if they produce convincing character moments empirically. Prior bad experience with mechanical keyword filtering. The LLM gets the literature as structured input, not as a replacement for judgment.
**Trade-offs:** Non-deterministic initially; harder to unit test; higher token cost per tick. Mitigated by eval framework (drive expression eval can measure regulation quality).
