# Session Handover

**Branch:** `main` (issue-437-lsp4ij-completions closed)
**Issue:** #437 — fix(intellij): LSP4IJ not delivering completions
**Date:** 2026-09-14

## What happened

Debugged and fixed LSP4IJ completion delivery for the IntelliJ plugin. Root cause was a dual-plugin conflict: `io.casehub.pages` (CaseHub Pages, from pages repo) and `io.casehub.yaml` (CaseHub YAML, from blocks-ui repo) were both installed, both registering LSP servers for the same YAML file patterns. LSP4IJ couldn't route documents with two competing servers.

Secondary issues fixed: stale bundle cache (extractServer never re-extracted), TextDocumentSync bare number form (LSP4IJ needs object form with `openClose: true`), missing Node.js macOS fallback paths in blocks-ui plugin, CompletionWeigher for YAML `{}` item deprioritization.

Verified end-to-end: file-based logging at `/tmp/casehub-lsp.log` confirms initialize → didOpen → completion handshake completes. Page completions appear in IntelliJ.

## Decisions / gotchas

- **Two plugins must never coexist.** CaseHub Pages (`io.casehub.pages`) and CaseHub YAML (`io.casehub.yaml`) have different plugin IDs but claim the same files. IntelliJ treats them as independent plugins. The rename from `io.casehub.yaml` → `io.casehub.pages` left the old installation behind.
- CaseHub YAML is the superset plugin (all 5 formats) but its bundle build fails — `.casehub-packages` in blocks-ui is stale (missing `lookupSchema`, `externalDataSetDefSchema` from pages-data).
- Currently CaseHub YAML is installed (without CaseHub Pages). It uses a pages-lsp bundle with Page schemas only — SWF/Case/HTN/Org return empty completions.
- Indentation bug: completion selection inserts text at column 0, losing YAML context indentation.
- File-based diagnostic logging (`/tmp/casehub-lsp.log`) is committed to pages main — remove after debugging is complete.

## Follow-up (3 items for next session)

1. **Sync `.casehub-packages` in blocks-ui** — rebuild from current pages source so lsp-schemas bundle builds. Then rebuild + reinstall CaseHub YAML with domain schemas.
2. **Fix indentation bug** — completion insertText doesn't preserve YAML indent context.
3. **Apply pages fixes to blocks-ui plugin** — TextDocumentSync object form, serverInfo, CompletionWeigher, stale cache removal. The blocks-ui `CaseHubLspServerDescriptor.kt` already has Node.js fallback paths and stale cache fix from this session.
